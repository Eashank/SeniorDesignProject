The port connection needs to be updated to the port the arduino is using. 
This can be found by going to tools>ports in Arduino. 

If there is an error saying port connection is busy, upload code to arduino then close 
the arduino window and run the GUI again. Once the GUI is on you can restart Arduino to look
at serial monitor if necessary. 

Installing the correct serial library might be tricky since there are two with the same name 
you was pyserial not serial. It will not work with Serial.



The use case is constantly changing baby
